# Internet Access Setup Guide

## 🌍 Making Your App Accessible from Any Network

There are several ways to make your Scrape the Plate application accessible from different networks (internet access):

## Option 1: 🚀 **Ngrok (Recommended - Easy & Free)**

### What is Ngrok?
Ngrok creates secure tunnels to your local development server, giving you a public URL.

### Setup Steps:

1. **Download & Install Ngrok:**
   - Go to https://ngrok.com/
   - Sign up for free account
   - Download ngrok for Windows
   - Extract to a folder (e.g., `C:\ngrok\`)

2. **Get your Auth Token:**
   - Login to ngrok dashboard
   - Copy your authtoken
   - Run: `ngrok authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN`

3. **Start your application normally:**
   ```cmd
   cd "d:\scarpe-the-plate-website"
   start-local.bat
   ```

4. **In separate terminals, create tunnels:**
   ```cmd
   # For Frontend (main website)
   ngrok http 5000
   
   # For Backend API
   ngrok http 3000
   
   # For Chatbot
   ngrok http 5001
   ```

5. **Ngrok will give you public URLs like:**
   - Frontend: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`
   - Backend: `https://def456.ngrok.io`
   - Chatbot: `https://ghi789.ngrok.io`

### Advantages:
- ✅ Free tier available
- ✅ HTTPS included
- ✅ Easy setup
- ✅ Works with firewalls/NAT

## Option 2: 🏠 **Port Forwarding (Router Setup)**

### Requirements:
- Access to your router admin panel
- Static local IP for your computer

### Steps:
1. **Set static IP for your computer**
2. **Access router admin (usually 192.168.1.1)**
3. **Forward these ports to your computer:**
   - Port 5000 → Your Computer (10.1.10.41:5000)
   - Port 3000 → Your Computer (10.1.10.41:3000)
   - Port 5001 → Your Computer (10.1.10.41:5001)

4. **Find your public IP:** https://whatismyipaddress.com/
5. **Access via:** `http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:5000`

### Advantages:
- ✅ No third-party service
- ✅ Direct connection

### Disadvantages:
- ❌ Router configuration needed
- ❌ Security considerations
- ❌ Dynamic IP may change

## Option 3: ☁️ **Cloud Deployment**

Deploy to cloud services for permanent internet access:

### Vercel (Frontend):
```bash
npm install -g vercel
cd frontend
vercel
```

### Railway/Heroku (Full Stack):
- Push to GitHub
- Connect Railway/Heroku to your repo
- Deploy automatically

### Advantages:
- ✅ Professional deployment
- ✅ Always online
- ✅ SSL included
- ✅ Custom domains

## Option 4: 🖥️ **VPS/Cloud Server**

Rent a cloud server (DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.) and deploy there.

## 🚀 **Recommended Quick Start with Ngrok:**

1. **Download ngrok:** https://ngrok.com/download
2. **Extract to C:\ngrok\**
3. **Add to PATH or use full path**
4. **Start your app:** `start-local.bat`
5. **In new terminal:** `ngrok http 5000`
6. **Share the ngrok URL with anyone!**

## 🔒 **Security Considerations:**

- **Development Mode:** Your app is in development mode - not production ready
- **Database:** Currently using SQLite - consider PostgreSQL for production
- **Authentication:** Ensure proper security before public access
- **Environment Variables:** Never expose API keys publicly
